# simpleWebScan
Simple web based scanner interface for SANE scanners.  I needed a super easy method of scanning a shoebox of photos.  All the scan tools I found were too many steps and too many options.  This tool has a single option, resolution.

This is a simple webserver written in bash using scanimage, imagemagick and netcat.  It autocrops to the photo, so you may need to add a colored frame to white documents.
